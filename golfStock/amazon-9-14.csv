"TE-MX-HY-MN",,,"Tour Edge Men's Bazooka HT Max Hybrid","The Tour Edge Men's Bazooka HT Max hybrid delivers advanced technology at an affordable price, and permits long and accurate shots.
Incorporating advanced heel-toe weighting, the Bazooka HT Max has four internal weight cavities in the heel and toe that lower the center of gravity and move it deeper in the club head for a higher moment of inertia (MOI - the club’s ability to resist twisting and to impart greater force on the ball). This helps the Bazooka deliver longer, more accurate shots than competitive hybrids.
The HT Max hybrid is cast using crown-pull technology that results in a thinner crown and face. Add a shallow face design and fixed weight screw for a lower center of gravity, and this hybrid is capable of delivering consistent, accurate shots. The HT’s hyper-steel head also boasts an expanded face size for an oversized sweet spot and larger effective hitting area. Combined with the ultra-thin face technology, the HT delivers longer shots, even on off-center hits.","Tour Edge",,"Four internal weight cavities in the heel and toe for superior stability.","20-gram tungsten sole weight provides a deeper, lower center of gravity.","Ultra-thin face technology rockets the ball from more points on the face.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"golf-hybrid-clubs","golf",,,,,"Mens",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Parent",,,"HandShaftMaterialGolfFlexGolfLoft",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
